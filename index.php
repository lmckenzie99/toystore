    <!-- TO-DO: Display the rest of the toys in the database

                Hint 1: You could copy/paste the toy-card block for each toy, but this would be repetitive.

                Hint 2: Instead, how could you modify the get_toy() function so it returns ALL toys
                        from the database instead of just one?

                Hint 3: Once you have an array of toys, how could you use a PHP loop to display
                        each toy inside a toy-card?
